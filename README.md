# ⚡ Electric Car Instrument Cluster Simulation

A visually engaging, browser-based electric vehicle instrument cluster built using **Vue** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project simulates a modern, non-traditional EV dashboard for display, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration purposes.

---

## 🚙 Overview

This simulation replicates the essential components of an EV dashboard interface including:

- **Dynamic speed indicator (KMPH)**
- **Lighting indicators** (low/high beam, daytime running, hazard, turn signals)
- **Real-time braking feedback**
- **Stylized wind tunnel animation when vehicle is in motion**
- **Minimalist inline gauges** for:
  - Fuel level
  - Windshield wiper fluid
  - Engine oil

All visuals are updated in real time using slider-based simulation controls.
